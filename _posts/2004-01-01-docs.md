# Documentation

### The **PDF** [manual]({{ site.url }}/downloads/manual.pdf)

The manual gives example usage of **Langmuir** and **LangmuirView**, as well as the input file format.
As a bonus, example usage of the *langmuir python module* is included!

### The **C++** [docs](cxx)

Langmuir is a multi-threaded, GPU enabled simulation framework written in c++ using Qt5, OpenCL, and boost.
Learn how it works by looking at the *Doxygen generated c++ documentation*.

### The **Python** [docs](python)

Making input files is hard.  That is why **Langmuir** comes with an extensive python module for making
this task easier.  The python documentation is generated with Sphinx.
